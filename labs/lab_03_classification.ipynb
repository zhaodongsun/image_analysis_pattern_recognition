    "### Create TensorFlow session and RUN!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the TensorFlow graph has been created, we have to create a TensorFlow session which is used to execute the graph and train our model. For this, we enter a session environment using a `tf.Session` as a context manager. We pass our graph  object to its constructor, so that it knows which graph to manage. To then execute nodes, we have several options. The   most general way is to call Session.run() and pass a list of tensors we wish to compute. Alternatively, we may call `eval()` on  tensors and `run()` on  operations directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before evaluating any other node, we must first ensure that the variables in our graph are initialized. Theoretically,  we could `run` the `Variable.initializer` operation for each variable. However, one most often just uses the\n",
    "`tf.initialize_all_variables()` utility operation provided by TensorFlow, which in turn executes the `initializer` \n",
    "operation for each `Variable` in the graph. Then, we can perform a certain number of iterations of stochastic gradient  descent, fetching an example and label from the MNIST dataset each time and feeding it to the run routine. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important point is that, there are many images in the training-set. Therefore, it takes a long time to calculate the gradient of the model using all these images. We therefore use Stochastic Gradient Descent which only uses a small batch of images in each iteration of the optimizer."
